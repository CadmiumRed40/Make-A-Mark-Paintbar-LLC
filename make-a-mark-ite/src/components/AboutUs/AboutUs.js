            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>You can book a seat to join a public event that is held at a public location. A booking includes a seat with an easel, canvas, paints, brushes and other materials. 
                If you have a large group of people you can book a private party which can be held at a location of your choice. Once you send a request for a Private Party we will contact you to schedule a time, figure out the amount of people and the painting you would like to paint.
                The best part of this experience is that you do not need any painting experience or artistic skill! 
                Our experienced instructors will help walk you through the painting and give you the encouragement you need to bring out your inner artist.
                We cannot wait to paint with you and your friends and family.</p>
